# WebRTC / Websocket interaction demo

This demo demonstrates pure websockets in conjunction with WebRTC to create
a video conference room without a media server in between... just WebRTC doing it's magic.

To get this set up,

```bash
> npm install
> node index.js
```

Now point your up-to-date Chrome/Firefox browser to http://localhost:8081
